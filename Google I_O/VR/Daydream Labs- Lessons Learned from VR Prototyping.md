  - Interactions
  - Immersion
  - Social

### Interactions
- controllers can turn into ANY tool
- Interaction Models
  - Direct manipulation of objects is very satisfying
  - Everyone really likes throwing things
  - Physical gestures can trigger events
- Stretch to scale
- Cloning
- Precise results from imprecise actions
- Tactile Interfaces
- Build environments that react to users
- Navigation can break immersion
- Small spaces can feel huge
- Lights, shadows, and textures help users perceive depth  

### Environments need sound to feel real
- 3D Data Visualization
- You don't have to replicate reality
- Experience the impossible

## Social in VR
### Avatars
- Simple avatars can be very expressive
- full body avatars are hard to get right

### Social Interactions
- Shared objectives help break the ice
- people aren't shy in VR
- people love physical contact
- show haptic feedback
- Trolling in VR
- Limit bad behavior by design
- VR will offer many ways to share
  - camera within VR
  - spectator camera in tilt brush
