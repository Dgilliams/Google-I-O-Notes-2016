## Awareness API
### Bhavik Singh and Maurice Chu
- Aware experiences help your users
  - streamline critical tasks, building retention
  - Suggest important actions, increasing CTR
  - Discover moments of delight, driving new users
- Android Awareness and Location APIs bridge the physical world of users and the digital world of Android to help build better applications

### Buckets
- Where you are
  1. fused location provider
  - Geofencing
  - Places API
    - Google Maps uses Plfaces and FLP (FusedLocationProvider) to help you navigate around the world
- What you're doing
  4. Activity recognition
    - Google Fit uses activity recognition to help you get in shape
  5. Fit platform
  - Sensor API
- Whats around you
  1. Nearby Messages
  - Nearby Comments
  - Nearby Notifications
    - Chromecast uses Nearby APIs to help you share your cast device with guests

## Maurice Talks
- There are 9 APIs (9 above)

### System health
Example: Driving a car on the road past the pharmacy you need to pick drugs up from
- Option A:
  - Turn on GPS API first, then the activity recognition
- B: Turn on activity recognition then GPS
- C: both at the same time

### Issues Today
- Multiple API for different signals
- No Combinations yet, must code links on your own
- Battery drain and sluggishness

## SOLUTION: AWARENESS API
- A unified sensing platform, enabling apps to be aware of all aspects of a users context while managing system health for you

7 Context types:
1. Location
- Place
- Beacons
- Time
- Activity
- Headphones
- Weather

### Fence API
- Callback style
- Same example as above

#### Use
AwarenessFence startDriving = DetectedActivityFence.starting(
DetectedActivityFence.IN_VEHICLE
)

areaAroundStore = LocationFence.in( STORE_LATITUDE, STORE_LONG, 1000, 0L);
)

##### Also needed

- .during(...)
- .inDailyInterval(...)
- .and(...)
- FenceUpdateRequest fenceUpdateRequest =  new FenceUpdateRequest,Builder().
- .addFence(...).addFence(...).build();

- Awareness.FenceApi.updateFences(...);

##### Write the callback
void onReceive(...){
  FenceState = FenceState.extract(...)
}

### Snapshot API
- Polling Style

#### Use
PlacesResult pr = Awareness.SnapshotApi.getPlaces(...).await();

### Easy Permission Management
- Location, place, beacon, weather
  - requires ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
- other
  - other
- other

### Other
- Tailored Notifications, not overload
- Be conscious of battery
