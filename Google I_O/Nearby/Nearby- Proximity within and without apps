## Wednesday May 18, 2016
Speakers
- Andrew Bunner
- Akshay Kannan @iamtheak

## Today's talk
- Discovery And Communication
- Scanning for BLE Beacons
- Something New!

## Currently
- Chromecast Guest mode
- Nearby.Messages Public API
  - Play services 2.3+
- Examples
  - Pocket Casts
    - Go to nearby tab, and post podcasts nearby
  - Trello
    - nearby can be used to start collaborations with people around you
    - simply passes the url over nearby


## Technical Details
- How it works
  - Publish and subscribe
  - BLE and ultra sound
    - BLE
      - 2.4 ghz radio
      - goes through walls
      - up to 100 feet
    - Ultrasound
      - 18.5 - 20 KHz audio
      - doesn't go through walls
      - around 5 feet
      - they use Speedyspectrum for analyzing sound waves


- Code
  - Nearby.Messages.publish(...)
    - less than 100kb
  - Nearby.Messages.subscribe(...)
  - strategy.setDistanceType(DISTANCE_TYPE_EARSHOT)
    - use for when you only want devices in the room

## Peer to Peer Permission
  - no manifest change
  - app will still auto update
  - transparent explanation
  - have the user do something explicit to turn on P-P so they realize what they're doing
  - there is an active notification while in use

## Beacons
- they emit identifiers (32 byte strings)
1. Scanning permission
  - only requires location
  - no more BLUETOOTH_ADMIN
    - breaks automatic updates!
  - continued auto-updates
  - works back to jelly bean
2. More free scans
  - every screen-on event
  - piggyback on other apps
  - piggyback on Location History
  - all nearby apps benefit from this search
3. Wakes your app
  - Nearby re-launches your app EVEN if it's been killed

## Nearby for Beacons
- Location permission only
- more free scans
- wakes your app up
- more coming
- will be on github
- **developers.google.com/nearby**

## Something New!
- Nearby Notifications
  - works on Jellybean+

## What can I tie to my beacon?
  - HTTPS Web URL
  - App intent with URL fallback
  - direct app install

## App install Criteria
 these are early thoughts, may change
 1. Proximity-relevant
 - Action orientated
 - broad appeal
 - jump right in

## Partners
 - United reminds you to download their video app so you don't have disappointed children that can't watch the in flight movie
 - CVS
 - The Broad
   - modern art museum in LA uses a beacon to tell you...
   # //TODO use beacon for what?
 - University of Notre Dame
   - this is a counter example
   - virtual tour with beacons around the campus
 - #Mobile Passport

 ## No programming Required
 - work is on the beacon side

 ### Start
1. Get Beacons (g.co/beacons)
- can also use phone as a beacon
2. Configure Beacons
  - install beacon maker app
 - choose either:
   - Eddystone URL (web)
   - Eddystone UID (web or app)
3. Register Beacons
4. Tie to web or app

## Beacon Attachment
{
"title":"fun partk",
"description":"ddd"
"url
}

examples of code titled...
- App install
- App with web fallback
- simply the web

developers.google.com/nearby

- you can set it up as debug so you can start now
