# Designing for Daydream
- Lindsay Metcalfe

## Audience
### 1. Virtual Reality is a gateway to enable new experience, perspectives and abilities

#### Uses
- Gaming
- Personal Cinema
- Take me there
- Bring us together
- Experiential learning
- Experiential Creation
- Professional Guidance


### 2. Sessions are 30+ minutes, not just snackable moments
### 3. In home visits
- standing gets tiring

## Ergonomics - Mike Alger
- easily move 80 degrees to each side but 30 is more comfortable
- vertically you look about 15 degrees down, but view is 70 degrees up and down
- depth should be meaningful and comfortable
  - too close (half meter)
  - too far (past 20 meter)
- imperfections give your eyes something to converge on
- Subtle texture noise is a big must for VR
- avoid high contrast edges and thin lines
- Text
  - current VR has 10-15 pixels per degree
  - 60 will be better soon
  - needs to be more than 14px before you brain knows what the letter is, 20px is good baseline to start with
- h = d* tan(px/pixelsperdegree)

## Environment Design - Brian Pullen
Does environment matter?
- Maintaining presence is a top priority

- Create a destination
- It's a physical representation of your brand
- Don't make a void as your main environment, its a waste of great space
- abstract environment is better than a void
- Convincing Sound is a necessity for presence
  - easy way to annoy your users if you do it wrong
- Comfort is Key
  - don't scare people with dark hallways
  - be aware of phobias!
    - don't scare away your users
  - frame your content
- Diegetic interface
  - use colors, lighting, animations, physics, use it all
- A living environment is much much better
  - use particle effects! super easy and brings the scene to life
- Details in the foreground


### 60fps all day every day
- <100 draw calls
- <100k polygons
- reduce pixel fill
- ODS: Omni-directional stereo image

## Daydream Controller
- included with every headset
- needed for the home screen
  - so you can design directly for it
- can be used for gesturing and pointing
  - 2 dimensional touchpad with click
  - app button! we can customize
  - home button and volume button
  - behaves like a laser pointer

### Daydream design playground
- Swinging an object
  - swinging a tennis racket
  - swinging a huge hammer on a massive instrument
  - a sword to chop shit
  - fishing rod
- flicking your wrist
  - spell cast on wand
  - pancake flipping
  - boomerang
- inspecting an object
  - controller can become the object
  - tilting an object around for gameplay like the marbles game
- moving an object
  - laser point to select, touchpad to rotate or bring towards you
  - assemble a 3d puzzle
  - operate a crane
- Carving
  - creating objects!
  - pottery wheel
- 3rd person character control
  - real time strategy game
  - point and click to move
  - click and drag to select multiple characters and move them around
- Flying
  - fly a kite
  - flying dragon

## In conclusion
- Users
  - 30 minutes+ sessions
- Ergonomics
  - base your designs on these metrics
- Environment
  - what emotion do you want to evoke?
  - you can take the user anywhere, get creative
- Controller
  - Broad and expressive gesture vocabulary
