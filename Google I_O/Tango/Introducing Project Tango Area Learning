# Introducing Project Tango Area Learning
## Wednesday May 18, 2016
- Wim Meeussen @wmeeusse Leads the Project Tango Location Team
- Goals Today
  - Lets make virtual objects in the real world!
  - Lets build tango multiplayer experiences!
  - The Future: Imagine never getting lost again!

## 3 Tango Areas
- Motion Tracking
  - Know where you are in the world
- Depth Perception
  - 3D camera on the phone to sense the world around it
  - query this info with 3D point clouds
- Area Learning
  - gives your tango device a memory

## How Area Learning Works!
- Tango recognizes landmarks in the world, tracks where they are when you move and maps the space

### Use Case for Area Learning
- never getting lost again, better room mapping

### Area Learning in the Real World
Where does it work (or sometimes not work)?
- Doesn't work always
  - messy closet vs clean closet
    - obviously the same closet with the same contents but different landmark layout
  - lighting day/night
    - same landmarks but not some found because not seen, or some found that weren't visible earlier
  - Large crowds can hide an area because they're blocking the landmarks
  - boring rooms with no landmarks
    - it's hard to map a room with nothing in it
  - seasons change landscapes
- So how do we deal with these?
  - Time, keep track of the area over time. Learns more over time
- Works well in controlled environments like your living room

### How to build an Area Learning Application!!!
- AR with drift correction
- Friday morning - How to build an AR end to end using Tango
- This example is how to port your existing AR to use Area Learning
- only two lines of code
  - //Configure drift free motion tracking
    ..  code code code
  // Query Drift Free motion tracking
    ... code ...

#### Way too much code to type :(

# Lenovo is teaming up with Tango to release a device later this year
