## Turning Dreams into Reality
### Design Processes
1. Rapid, exploratory prototyping (DayDream Labs)
- Iterative, production-oriented


- Hardware
- Design Patterns
- Computation

Challenges i VR Design
- New UI Standards and design patterns
- HMDs  (Head Mounted Devices) have unique design concerns
- new input methods and tools
- new skill sets and design tools
- new team foundations

## Rapid Prototyping
- Explore everything, fail fast
- Daydream labsss
### Process
#### Step 1: Brainstorm ideas
    - ask anyone for ideas, everyone has them
    - creative exercises
      - Don't be incremental
      - you don't have to be literal
      - crank it to 11
      - apply creative constraints
        - "The more constraints one composes... obtain precision on execution." - Igor Stravin...

#### Step 2: Rank ideas
- better or only possible in VR
- hasn't been done before
- wow factor
- a good fit for your team
- good scope for a 1-week sprint
- more than just pure entertainment

#### Step 3: Implement
- - plan for 2 days and stretch to 5
- Nerd Sniping - a problem thats too fun for your brain to say no

#### Share
- Demo Party every Monday afternoon
  - everyone must leave one sticky note with feedback
- feedback on small chunks is better than large chunks

#### Document the findings
- Example findings
- 30 second video
- summary of the sticky notes

### A Week in the life
- Monday: Plan projects
- Tue - Thurs: Extract findings, iterate on design  
- Friday: Test, polish, narrow ideas for next week

### Prevent burnout
- Scope for 2 days, stretch for 5
- Block out time for each step in the process
- Pick ideas you're passionate about
- Creative drought?

### Findings
- Lessons Learned from Daydream Labs

## Design Process 2: Iterative Production-oriented design
- VR is a unique platform
- User behavior is different
- Many new skills and considerations
- Our traditional process wouldn't work for VR
- How we got into VR as quickly as possible
  - Hand sketching!
  - volumetric layout


## Build your VR Team
- What kind of design team do you want to build?

### Three unique attributes of teams
- designers wear multiple hats
- collaboration is fundamental
- focus is on skill, not roles

### VR design deam requires diverse skills
- 3D
- Prototype
- interaction design
- visual design
- motion
- audio
- research

## Start with at least 2 designers
- at least these 2 skills
- 3D design
- prototyping
- interaction design

## Where are these designers?
- Gaming
- VFX
- Web and Mobile
- Design Schools

## Where do they hang out?
- VR Jams, Game Jams
- Conferences and Tech Events
  - SVVR, SFVR, IEEE VR
- Social Media

## What to look for in a VR Designer?
- Experience of designing in VR, tinkerers?
- Diverse Skill sets
- Passion for VR

## Four Takeaways for building a team
- Value skills over roles
- Encourage the team to learn and share
- keep an open mind for fresh talent
- cast a wide net
- get help from a design studio if necessary

## Advice for designers
- Learn from your own VR experiences
  - Keep a journal of them and what works
- Learn the tools
  - Unity and Unreal
  - 3ds Max
  - Maya
  - Cinema4D
  - Blender
- Learning curve is steep, be persistent
